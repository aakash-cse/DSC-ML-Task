## DSC-ML-Task

# Task-1
There is an Inclass Kaggle Competition conducted which tests your understanding on building SOTA models for a particular task. You along with the other 31 selected candidates will be given access to the dataset and are asked to build a deep model within 4 days. This also tests your ability to adapt to a new environment and how to consistently keep updating your model performance based on the current scenario.
# Task-2
EDA- Exploratory data Analysis, should be performed on a custom data (the link to which is provided). Draw a neat inference from the various columns and bring out the data scientist in you. This task evaluates your skills in drawing inference, plotting techniques and working with structured data. You don't have to fit a model, but don't lose any opportunity to impress us.
